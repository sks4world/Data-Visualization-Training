Description

Dataset is from "Moro,S., Rita,P., and Cortez,P.. (2012). Bank Marketing. UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://doi.org/10.24432/C5K306"

1. Download the dataset from the link https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing
2. Create a presentation or pdf file with the following visualizations of the dataset
3. Read the dataset 'bank-additional.csv'
4. Draw a scatter plot 'age' on y-axis and the outcome target variable 'y' (has the client subscribed a term deposit?) on the x axis
5. Create a bar chart of outcome target variable 'y' (has the client subscribed a term deposit?) grouped by the variable 'job'. This will lead to one bar per job type type of job (categorical: 'admin.','blue-collar','entrepreneur','housemaid','management','retired','self-employed','services','student','technician','unemployed','unknown')
6. Create a histogram of the variable 'campaign' (number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)). This should show the most frequent number of contacts and the least frequent number of contacts made during the campaign.
7. Review each chart has the following basic requirements: i). Title of the chart ii). X-axis label and Y-axis label iii). The X-ticks and Y-ticks are readable, sized properly, not overlapping iv). A small description of what you observed from the chart written at the bottom of each chart
8. Create a Github account and create a new project (name the project broadly such as 'Data Analysis and Visualization Projects' or something similar, so that multiple sub-projects can be created under it
9. Create the first project under it using the information from the Dataset. 
10. In the Readme section of the project, cite the dataset (as shown above) and reuse the description from the dataset. At the bottom of it, if you find something interesting or appropriate, add your own description to enrich it.

As an outcome of conducting the above project, just share your Github link which contains the description as above, your output presentation or pdf and code for review and feedback.
