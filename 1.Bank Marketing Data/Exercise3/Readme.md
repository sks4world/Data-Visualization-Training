Description

Dataset is from "Moro,S., Rita,P., and Cortez,P.. (2012). Bank Marketing. UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://doi.org/10.24432/C5K306" Dataset Information

Dataset Information:

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

There are four datasets:

    bank-additional-full.csv with all examples (41188) and 20 inputs, ordered by date (from May 2008 to November 2010), very close to the data analyzed in [Moro et al., 2014]
    bank-additional.csv with 10% of the examples (4119), randomly selected from 1), and 20 inputs.
    bank-full.csv with all examples and 17 inputs, ordered by date (older version of this dataset with less inputs).
    bank.csv with 10% of the examples and 17 inputs, randomly selected from 3 (older version of this dataset with less inputs).

Exercise Tasks:
1. Use the data from bank-additional.csv and prepare a descriptive dashboard with the following elements in it
2. Count of campaigns
3. A line plot showing age bracket on x-axis and number of subscriptions after the campaign on y-axis
4. A horizontal bar chart showing number of males and females contacted
5. A cross-tab showing the number of males and females who subscribed and who did not subscribe
6. A two axis line plot with one y-axis showing the number of subscriptions and the other y-axis showing the duration of campaign, with x-axis showing age bracket
7. Two pie charts showing the distribtion of 'contact' for successful subscriptions and distribution of 'contact' for subscribed 'No'
8. A bar chart showing the number of subscriptions yes and no by day of the week (if a day is absent in dataset, impute 0)
9. Title the dashboard
10. Write a summary about the dashboard and present the dashboard in a powerpoint presentation, assuming, this is presented to a business manager for decision making. Upload the output in the github and share the github link
